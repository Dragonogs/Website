          This project Initially started during my ICT college course, where I
          was tasked with creating a website for a fictional business. I was
          given a selection of logos to choose from, such as an outdoor retailer
          or a luxury jewelry store. I decided to go with the Diamond Jewellery
          logo so I could make a sleek and elegant design.

            For the first iteration of the website, I utilized Bootstrap
            components and basic JavaScript. Despite the initial design being
            quite simplistic and relying on what I now view as unattractive
            Bootstrap elements, my enthusiasm for web development set my project
            apart. My site ended up looking better than most of my classmates'
            projects. Although this first iteration was very bare-bones, I felt
            it was a decent effort for one of my first websites.
          </p>

          />
          <p class="article-p">
            Once I had left college I decided I was going to revisit the website
            and improve upon it in order to make it fully functional with
            dynamically rendered items from a database and a cart system. To do
            this I chose to use PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for
            database management. However, while using PHP I encountered
            difficulties in trying to update the shopping cart counter on
            multiple pages, which led me to temporarily abandon the project for
            a while.
          </p>
          <p class="article-p">
            After some time, I came back to the project and quickly realized I
            had forgotten how most of the PHP I had written worked. Still stuck
            with the issue of rendering cart information on multiple pages, I
            decided it would be better to rewrite the entire website using
            modern web technologies. I opted for a MySQL - Express - React -
            NodeJS (MERN) stack, as it seemed the most logical and
            straightforward approach, using my basic knowledge of JavaScript.
            Through this process, I gained much more experience in both
            front-end and back-end development. On the front end, I used React
            and CSS to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, while on
            the back end, I built a RESTful API using Express and NodeJS to
            query my MySQL database and serve it to the front end.

          <p class="article-p">
            One of the most significant challenges I faced (other than CORS
            errors) was managing secure user logins and personalized content.
            Despite initial difficulties in understanding how to implement
            secure authentication, I eventually decided to use JSON Web Tokens
            (JWT) instead of session IDs due to their simplicity. However, My
            implementation does have a vulnerability: the JWTs issued have
            1000-day expiration timers and only expire upon user logout. This
            means that a malicious actor could hijack a token and gain prolonged
            access to a user's account. This could easily be solved by reducing
            the token expiration time and implementing token renewal mechanisms
            to enhance security, I decided it was overkill for the scope of the
            project.
